# DSS-predict
this repositories is for the prediction of DSS value using chromatin state (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq) data

Idea:

build a model to bridge the chromatin state data and drug response data (drug screen data)

try different kinds of model
1. linear regression model
2. tree model: ensemble model, random forest model
3. deep learning model
